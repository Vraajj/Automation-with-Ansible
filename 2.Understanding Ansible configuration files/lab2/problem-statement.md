Create a Ansible configuration file in the folder `practice` where:
1) The configuration file points to the inventory file in 
   the current directory.
2) While the server ssh's in the client machine, it 
   becomes the `root` user using the `sudo` method.

After creating the configuration file, from the `practice`
directory, run the command:
```
$ ansible --version
```
